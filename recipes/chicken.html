        <h2>Chicken with mushrooms, the perfect combination</h2>
        <p>
            I made this dish with Hatch chiles that I had in my freezer and some onions and mushrooms that 
            needed to be used. I served it over a bed of cilantro-lime rice.  
            that I already had. I shredded my chicken breast and 
            mixed it in with the rice. Hubby preferred his chicken breast whole. We're going through a 
            stay-at-home order due to the Coronavirus pandemic and this was a great meal to make with items

            <li>4 Hatch chile peppers, halved and seeded </li>
            <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Spray a slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Place chicken breasts in the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet until shimmering. Add onion; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until onion is translucent and mushrooms are soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Transfer the onion mixture to the slow cooker. Add chicken broth, taco seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook on High for 1 hour 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place chile peppers cut-side down on baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Broil the chile peppers until skin is heavily blistered and turning black, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chile peppers to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow to steam as they cool, about 15 minutes. Remove the skins and chop the flesh into 1-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Add Hatch chiles and heavy whipping cream to the slow cooker and cook for 30 minutes more.</li>
